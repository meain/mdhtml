mdhtml

Convert a raw markdown source and display it as html.
Kinda similar to [marker](https://github.com/meain/marker)

Sample workflow:
- You write a markdown file
- You host it using gist or some pastebin
- Put the link here and get a new link
- Share a pretty markdown page with your team on Slack
